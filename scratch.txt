# Intention:
#   Be able to have entire development env for webapps, as long as I have docker
#   - install docker
#   - Pull image from registry, run container, which includes: node, npm, git, and helper scripts
#   - Helper scripts should let me:
#       - Start fresh webapp project (like create-nuxt-app but include my jest test setup or any other of my needs)
#           - This may mean, git clone /my-exemplar-url.git, run npm install, run npm test
#           - prints to screen 'You can now run "npm run dev" and visit localhost:3000, etc
#       - Continue working from one of my current projects
#           - This may mean, take proj-name as input, git clone /proj-name.git, run npm install, run npm test
#       - Run one of my projects in production mode
#           - take proj as input, git clone /proj.gi, run npm install, run npm test, run npm build, run npm start
#           - .. deal with any other production related situations
#
# Windows 10
# node v8.11.3
# npm 5.6.0
